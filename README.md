![Toronto Island Electric Diesel Ferry](https://www.toronto.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/915e-ferry-fleet-replacement-pax-rendering-banner.png)

The City of Toronto has allocated funding for constructing and delivering two fully electric ferries, with funding for additional vessels subject to approval. Our group aims to determine whether ticket sales and redemption trends over the past decade justify replacing the Toronto Island ferry fleet.
